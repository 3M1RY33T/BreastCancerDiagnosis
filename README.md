# Breast Cancer Diagnosis

This project is developed using C++. and the purpose of this project is an applied demonstration of decision trees and data 
mining techniques.
 
The Breast Cancer Diagnosis project uses decision trees and data mining techniques to decide if a patient’s tumor is benign or 
malignant using:
- The patient information contained in CSV file, which is then split into its atomic values and transformed in the application
  into individual items.
- A decision tree containing the parameters of each patient's attributes (patient’s tumor size, shape and texture), to run each
  item by.

The items are then run by the decision tree, revealing the diagnosis of a patient. The parameters used to build the decision
tree is taken from the research included in this project at: Diagnosis-of-Breast-Cancer-using-Decision-Tree-Data-Mining-Technique.pdf
